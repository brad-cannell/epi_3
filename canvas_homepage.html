  <h1>Instructions for using the Course websites</h1>
  
  <p>
    Welcome to the Canvas website for PH2710 - Epidemiology 3. To complete this course, you will actually need to use a few additional websites as well. This may cause a little bit of confusion at first, but my hope is that it will allow you to access the best available tools for learning R programming and it will allow you to continue to access course resources long after the semester is completed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Here is a list of the websites we will use in this course along with a brief overview of how we will use them:</b>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><b>Canvas</b>: Discussion board, submit assignments and quizzes, and view your grades on assignments and quizzes</li>
    <li><a href="https://brad-cannell.github.io/epi_3/" target="_blank"><b>Epi 3 Course Website</b></a>: View the course outline, view individual learning modules, and access links to course resources</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank"><b>DataCamp</b></a>: A tool for practicing your R programming online and getting real-time feedback</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    You should not have to do anything special to access the course website -- just click on the link above. I also recommend that you bookmark the course website in your browser of choice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Before you can use DataCamp, you will need to sign up for a free account. Below are some instructions for doing so.

  <h1>Using DataCamp</h1>
  
  <p><i>What is DataCamp?</i></p>
  
  <p>DataCamp is an incredible resource for interactively learning to program in R, Python, and SQL. The website is broken into topic-specific courses that include videos, readings, and interactive coding sessions that provide you with immediate feedback about any errors in your code. Typically, you have to pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee to access DataCamp courses. However, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education" target="_blank">DataCamp for the Classroom</a> allows me to provide you with access to all of DataCamp's courses free of charge for 6 months. All you have to do is register!</p>
  
  <p><i>How do I get free access to DataCamp?</i></p>
  
  <p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/dc7b2ea2a51b3f1c6d12631d5b3cf92460832c3a" target="_blank">To access DataCamp for free, just click on this link and follow the setup instructions</a></p>
